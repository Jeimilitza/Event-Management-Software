# Event-Management-Software
The aim of this project is to develop a software application that allows users to input and store dated events and appointments. These entries are saved and retained between program runs for future use and can be displayed in chronological order. The program also provides reminders for approaching appointments and offers weather predictions for specified cities upon user request.
