The aim of this project is to develop a software application that allows users to input and store dated events and appointments. These entries are saved and retained between program runs for future use and can be displayed in chronological order. The program also provides reminders for approaching appointments and offers weather predictions for specified cities upon user request.


Instructions to use the program:
First, open your command prompt or terminal. Then write "pip install 'module_name'", inserting each of the python libraries in the 'module_name':

Python libraries:
1)- winotify
2)- pickle
3)- datetime
4)- requests
5)- sys
Once all the libraries are installed, make sure that your computer has notifications turned ON. Going to Settings>System>Notifications>TurnON. Now the file is ready to be executed.

Modifications made: The use of forecasting weather with python was implemented in one of my functions called "displayWeather" to aid the process of getting weather forecast information from the web.
